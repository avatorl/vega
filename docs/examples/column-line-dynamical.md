An example of a Vega visualization that automatically switches between a Column chart and a Line chart depending on the number of data points.

Use the slider to change the number of data points displayed on the chart. For more than 50 data points, the chart type will be changed from a Column chart to a Line chart (with interpolation).

This Vega example made by Andrzej Leszkiewicz [@avatorl](https://github.com/avatorl).
